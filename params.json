If you don't have bower,\r\n`npm install -g bower`.\r\n\r\nThe above steps will download all the required software to\r\nbuild and run this app, such as [grunt](http://gruntjs.com),\r\n[requirejs](http://requirejs.org), and [jquery](http://jquery.com).\r\n\r\n## Running the server\r\n\r\nYou can run your app using `grunt preview`. This will start a\r\nserver on `localhost:8000`, meaning you can simply go to the\r\nurl [localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html)\r\nwhile it's running.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to run the compiled version, run\r\n`grunt preview-live`.\r\n\r\n## Building the application\r\n\r\nThis application uses requirejs to load the various modules in\r\nthe app folder. However, upon build, all of these files are\r\nconcatenated and minified together to create a small, compressed\r\njavascript file.\r\n\r\nRunning `grunt` by itself will run through all of the steps of\r\nlinting the javascript, building out dependencies and ultimately\r\ncreating `/dist/require.js`.\r\n\r\n## Working with the scaffolded app\r\n\r\nThere's just enough to in place to get you going. Go ahead\r\nand make your changes to `index.html`. You'll start your\r\njavascript work in `app/main.js` by requiring your first\r\nmodules. Past that, well, the world is your oyster.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThe test directory uses `qunit`, which is run using phantomJS\r\nin the console, but can also be ran by launching the server\r\n`grunt preview` and going to `localhost:8000/test/index.html`.\r\n\r\nCreate tests in the `test/tests.js` file, where you can\r\nrequire your modules and test their functionality.\r\n\r\n## Deploying your application on a server\r\n\r\nAssuming you're already ran `npm install` and `bower install`,\r\nthe only pieces required to run the application in its built\r\nstate is running `grunt`.\r\n\r\nIf you're using a webserver like apache or nginx, you'll want\r\nto create a redirect from `/components/requirejs/require.js` to\r\n`/dist/require.js`. (*Note: this is exactly what `grunt\r\npreview-live` does*)\r\n",
